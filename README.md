# Dream Generator website

This website generates a dream for you.

It all runs in the browser.
The text generation code is in `dream-generator-v0.1.1.js`
which is copied from the `dream-generator` package
([github](https://github.com/cinnamon-bun/dream-generator), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dream-generator))

There's additional code in `index.html` to make the text appear line-by-line.

# Hosting on Glitch

The live website is at [https://dream-generator.glitch.me](https://dream-generator.glitch.me)

The Glitch project can be [edited and remixed here](https://glitch.com/~dream-generator).
